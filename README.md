## About the App

Community Table was developed with the idea of being charitable to our neighbors and communities, while also
being clear and accessible to anyone who might need it. Our design philosphy was primarily focused on making
the website modern and clean looking without compromising functionality that may be missed by someone who
isn't technically inclined. The site allows new users to create an account and immediately view resources
posted by other users in their area or post their own resources they'd like to donate to someone in need.
Once a resource is posted, another user can 'claim' the resource. This will share their contact info with the
user donating, and allow them to meet up to exchange the goods in question.
